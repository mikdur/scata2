# scata2

New implementation of the SCATA pipeline and web service. Major goals for the
new version are:

- The system should be containerised in Docker.
- Easy setup in order to enable self-hosting/running on own hardware
- Pluggable clustering modules.


## Notes
Packages that should be evaluated as possible solutions to some 
functions. (Akin to notes to self)
- django-private-storage to require authenticated users for file access
- django-cleanup 
- django-allauth

## Development

Currently all development takes place in the main branch. The system is not
yet fully functional.
